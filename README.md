Relearning C programming, algorithms and graphs, and creating simple documented example programs with explanations.  Caution: I am not an expert.

    mergeSort
    This program is a C implementation of the merge sort algorithm described on
    pages 82-83 in the text "Algorithms in a Nutshell" 2nd Edition by Heineman,
    Pollice, and Selkow.

    The program is limited to a maximum of 100 records.  No record can be
    longer than 9 characters (10 counting the ending null.)  This version of
    the program is also limited by the requirement that numeric data must be
    left padded with leading zeros.  Input data are ASCII characters.

    onehundrednumbers.txt
    A datafile of 100 numbers 1-100 in random order left padded with leading zeros.
    
    ptrAdd.c
    Use only pointers to do array stuff.  Demonstrates allocating memory and pointers,
    reading string data into memory pointed to by pointer, pass pointer to a function,
    printing strings pointed to by pointer, and pointer addition.  Input data is string data.
    
    rmaze.c
    This program uses a recursive depth-first search algorithm to solve a maze.
    This C program was derived from a Python program written and demonstrated on YouTube
    by Richard West.
    
    wordsdata.txt
    A datafile of 1 to 6 character unsorted words, all lower case, for use as an input file.
