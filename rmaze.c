rmaze.c                                                            24-July-2021

    This program uses a recursive depth-first search algorithm to solve a maze.
    This     C program was derived from a Python program written and
    demonstrated on YouTube by Richard West.  His video can be found here:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP94WC_XnZc  and his website can be found
    here: https://learnlearn.uk/about/

    I took his Python program and rewrote it in C.  Having done that I then
    used LaTeX to write a paper describing haw the depth-first search algorithm
    and this program work.

    The sole purpose of this project was to play with the LaTeX typesetting
    software, practice programming, and relearn some forgotten theory.

    The C source code is well documented and meaningful variable names and
    function names have been used.

    This program is not a graphics program.  It displays the maze and its
    progress on the screen of an ordinary ANSI terminal that recognizes
    ordinary ANSI escape codes.  Mac has such a terminal to access the Linux
    command line, and Windows DOS command line will also work.

    The program has a system("clear") call in the display routine to clear
    the screen.  Windows users will need to change that to "cls" before
    compiling.

    cc rmaze.c -o rmaze
    ./rmaze mazefile.csv

    The maze is built by hand as a comma separated values (csv) data file.
    The perimeter and internal walls are represented with ones and pathways
    are represented with zeros.  The finish, represented with the letter F
    can be anywhere in the maze.  If the finish can not be reached the
    program backtracks all the way back to the start then quits.  The
    starting position is hard coded into the program at row 2 column 1.
    The maze can be no larger than 50x50 but that could take a long time
    to build and a long time to solve.

    Here is a sample maze:

    1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
    S,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
    1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
    1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
    1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1
    1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
    1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1
    1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
    1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
    1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
    1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
    1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1
    1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1
    1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1
    1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1
    1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,F,1
